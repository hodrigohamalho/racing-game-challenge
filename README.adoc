= Racing Game Challenge 

Let's introduce you to the APIs ecosystem by living a real practical experience of a racing game using IoT cars. 

You, as a participant, will be part of a squad, and the team's goal is to interact with APIs that can guide your robot car 
through the speedway. 
Besides having lots of fun in this competition, you will learn and understand how to interact, 
manage and consume real APIs in a practical and enterprise-oriented way using 3Scale.
